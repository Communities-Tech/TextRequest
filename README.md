# MyFirstProject

This project was generated with a deprecated [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.4. Beware that all ng commands should be run within the context of `npm` and best practice would be to use a Node Version Manager such as NVM or your preference. `nvm use 16.13`

## Install Dependencies 
run `npm ci` to ensure package versions are met exactly. 

## Serve Project

Run `npm ng serve` To serve - This will only serve, not run the project. 

## Build & Run 
run `npm ng build` to build then `npm run start` in order to run on localhost:3000 - Full URL with actual backend data: `localhost:3000/?phone=8067906072&firstName=allie&lastName=test%20allie&userId=0053m00000AhgChAAJ&allowedServices=8063753738;8063040609`

Note: this doesn't include hotloading at this moment in time - fix incoming. 

## Code scaffolding

Run `npm ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `npm ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
